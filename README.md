Class projects for Stat 637: Generalized Linear Models

MiniProject4: This was a class competition to predict the number of stars a reviewer gave Statistical Inference by Casella and Berger on Amazon. Our professor gave us 2/3rds of the scraped data (including the text of the review, the date, verified user, etc) and kept 1/3 of it to test our predictive accuracy (MSE). Because most of the covariates had very little relation to the response, I went with an extremely simple model just using log(word count), an indicator for whether the user was a verified purchase, and the sentiment scores provided by the package sentimentr. This model had the lowest MSE of anyone in my class.

MormonsData: This project examines some of the messy relationship between race and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints by examining a survey of church members from the 1960s. We examined some attitudes toward race and specifically how scriptural knowledge correlates with these attitudes. This project can be very confusing to people not well versed in Church history, and I invite you to reach out if you have questions.
